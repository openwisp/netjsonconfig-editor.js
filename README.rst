Tests
~~~~~

- In order to run tests for the code written run the command ``npm run test`` writing tests is
  an essential part of the project.

- Ensure to run a build before trying to run any tests. The tests will fail if you don't.

- All new features added to the editor need to be accompanied with appropriate tests, but also
  ensuring that tets written before do not fail.

- netjsonconfig-editor.js uses mocha js as the test framework, chaijs as the assertion library
